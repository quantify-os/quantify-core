A 1D Batched loop: Resonator Spectroscopy
-----------------------------------------


Defining a simple model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


In this example, we want to find the resonance of some device. We expect to find it's resonance somewhere in the low 6 GHz range, but manufacturing imperfections makes it impossible to know exactly without inspection.


We first create `freq`: a :class:`.Settable` with a :class:`~qcodes.instrument.parameter.Parameter` to represent the frequency of the signal probing the resonator, followed by a custom :class:`.Gettable` to mock (i.e. emulate) the resonator.
The :class:`!Resonator` will return a Lorentzian shape centered on the resonant frequency. Our :class:`.Gettable` will read the setpoints from `freq`, in this case a 1D array.


.. note:: The `Resonator` :class:`.Gettable` has a new attribute `.batched` set to `True`. This property informs the :class:`.MeasurementControl` that it will not be in charge of iterating over the setpoints, instead the `Resonator` manages its own data acquisition. Similarly, the `freq` :class:`.Settable` must have a `.batched=True` so that the :class:`.MeasurementControl` hands over the setpoints correctly.


.. jupyter-execute::

    # Note that in an actual experimental setup `freq` will be a QCoDeS parameter
    # contained in a QCoDeS Instrument
    freq = ManualParameter(name="frequency", unit="Hz", label="Frequency")
    freq.batched = True  # Tells meas_ctrl that the setpoints are to be passed in batches


    def lorenz(amplitude: float, fwhm: float, x: int, x_0: float):
        """Model of the frequency response."""
        return amplitude * ((fwhm / 2.0) ** 2) / ((x - x_0) ** 2 + (fwhm / 2.0) ** 2)


    class Resonator:
        """
        Note that the Resonator is a valid Gettable not because of inheritance,
        but because it has the expected attributes and methods.
        """

        def __init__(self) -> None:
            self.name = "resonator"
            self.unit = "V"
            self.label = "Amplitude"
            self.batched = True
            self.delay = 0.0

            # hidden variables specifying the resonance
            self._test_resonance = 6.0001048e9  # in Hz
            self._test_width = 300  # FWHM in Hz

        def get(self) -> float:
            """Emulation of the frequency response."""
            time.sleep(self.delay)
            _lorenz = lambda x: lorenz(1, self._test_width, x, self._test_resonance)
            return 1 - np.array(list(map(_lorenz, freq())))

        def prepare(self) -> None:
            """Adding this print statement is not required but added for illustrative
            purposes."""
            print("\nPrepared Resonator...")

        def finish(self) -> None:
            """Adding this print statement is not required but added for illustrative
            purposes."""
            print("\nFinished Resonator...")


    gettable_res = Resonator()



Running the experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Just like our Iterative 1D loop, our complete experiment is expressed in just four lines of code.


The main difference is defining the `batched` property of our :class:`.Gettable` to `True`.
The :class:`.MeasurementControl` will detect these settings and run in the appropriate mode.


.. jupyter-execute::

    # At this point the `freq` parameter is empty
    print(freq())



.. jupyter-execute::

    meas_ctrl.settables(freq)
    meas_ctrl.setpoints(np.arange(6.0001e9, 6.00011e9, 5))
    meas_ctrl.gettables(gettable_res)
    dset = meas_ctrl.run()



.. jupyter-execute::

    plotmon.main_QtPlot



As expected, we find a Lorentzian spike in the readout at the resonant frequency, finding the peak of which is trivial.


Memory-limited Settables/Gettables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Instruments (either physical or virtual) operating in `batched` mode have an upper limit on how many datapoints can be processed at once.
When an experiment is comprised of more datapoints than the instrument can handle, the :class:`.MeasurementControl` takes care of fulfilling the measurement of all the requested setpoints by running and internal loop.


By default the :class:`.MeasurementControl` assumes no limitations and passes all setpoints to the `batched` settable. However, as a best practice, the instrument limitation must be reflected by the `.batch_size` attribute of the `batched` settables. This is illustrated below.


.. jupyter-execute::

    # Tells meas_ctrl that only 256 datapoints can be processed at once
    freq.batch_size = 256

    gettable_res.delay = 0.05  # short delay for plotting
    meas_ctrl.settables(freq)
    meas_ctrl.setpoints(np.arange(6.0001e9, 6.00011e9, 5))
    meas_ctrl.gettables(gettable_res)
    dset = meas_ctrl.run()



.. jupyter-execute::

    plotmon.main_QtPlot



Software Averaging: T1 Experiment
---------------------------------


In many cases it is desirable to run an experiment many times and average the result, such as when filtering noise on instruments or measuring probability.
For this purpose, the :meth:`.MeasurementControl.run` provides the `soft_avg` argument.
If set to *x*, the experiment will run *x* times whilst performing a running average over each setpoint.


In this example, we want to find the relaxation time (aka T1) of a Qubit. As before, we define a :class:`.Settable` and :class:`.Gettable`, representing the varying timescales we will probe through and a mock Qubit emulated in software.
The mock Qubit returns the expected decay sweep but with a small amount of noise (simulating the variable qubit characteristics). We set the qubit's T1 to 60 ms - obviously in a real experiment we would be trying to determine this, but for this illustration purposes in this tutorial we set it to a known value to verify our fit later on.


Note that in this example meas_ctrl is still running in Batched mode.


.. jupyter-execute::

    def decay(t, tau):
        """T1 experiment decay model."""
        return np.exp(-t / tau)


    time_par = ManualParameter(name="time", unit="s", label="Measurement Time")
    # Tells meas_ctrl that the setpoints are to be passed in batches
    time_par.batched = True


    class MockQubit:
        """A mock qubit."""

        def __init__(self):
            self.name = "qubit"
            self.unit = "%"
            self.label = "High V"
            self.batched = True

            self.delay = 0.01  # sleep time in secs
            self.test_relaxation_time = 60e-6

        def get(self):
            """Adds a delay to be able to appreciate the data acquisition."""
            time.sleep(self.delay)
            rel_time = self.test_relaxation_time
            _func = lambda x: decay(x, rel_time) + rng.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
            return np.array(list(map(_func, time_par())))



We will then sweep through 0 to 300 ms, getting our data from the mock Qubit. Let's first observe what a single run looks like:


.. jupyter-execute::

    meas_ctrl.settables(time_par)
    meas_ctrl.setpoints(np.linspace(0.0, 300.0e-6, 300))
    meas_ctrl.gettables(MockQubit())
    meas_ctrl.run("noisy")  # by default `.run` uses `soft_avg=1`
    plotmon.main_QtPlot



Alas, the noise in the signal has made this result unusable! Let's set the `soft_avg` argument of the :meth:`.MeasurementControl.run` to 100, averaging the results and hopefully filtering out the noise.


.. jupyter-execute::

    dset = meas_ctrl.run("averaged", soft_avg=100)
    plotmon.main_QtPlot



Success! We now have a smooth decay curve based on the characteristics of our qubit. All that remains is to run a fit against the expected values and we can solve for T1.


.. jupyter-execute::

    model = Model(decay, independent_vars=["t"])
    fit_res = model.fit(dset["y0"].values, t=dset["x0"].values, tau=1)

    fit_res.plot_fit(show_init=True)
    fit_res.values



Interrupting
------------


Sometimes experiments unfortunately do not go as planned and it is desirable to interrupt and restart them with new parameters. In the following example, we have a long running experiment where our Gettable is taking a long time to return data (maybe due to misconfiguration).
Rather than waiting for this experiment to complete, instead we can interrupt any :class:`.MeasurementControl` loop using the standard interrupt signal.
In a terminal environment this is usually achieved with a ``ctrl`` + ``c`` press on the keyboard or equivalent, whilst in a Jupyter environment interrupting the kernel (stop button) will cause the same result.


When the :class:`.MeasurementControl` is interrupted, it will wait to obtain the results of current iteration (or batch) and perform a final save of the data it has gathered, call the `finish()` method on Settables & Gettables (if it exists) and return the partially completed dataset.


.. note::

    The exact means of triggering an interrupt will differ depending on your platform and environment; the important part is to cause a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception to be raised in the Python process.


.. warning::

    In case the current iteration is taking too long to complete (e.g. instruments not responding), you may force the execution of any python code to stop by signaling the same interrupt 5 times (e.g. pressing 5 times ``ctrl`` + ``c``). Mind that performing this too fast might result in the `KeyboardInterrupt` not being properly handled and corrupt the dataset!


    .. jupyter-execute::
        :raises: KeyboardInterrupt


        class SlowGettable:
            """A mock slow gettables."""

            def __init__(self):
                self.name = "slow"
                self.label = "Amplitude"
                self.unit = "V"

            def get(self):
                """Get method."""
                time.sleep(1.0)
                if time_par() == 4:
                    # This same exception rises when pressing `ctrl` + `c`
                    # or the "Stop kernel" button is pressed in a Jupyter(Lab) notebook
                    if sys.platform == "win32":
                        # Emulating the kernel interrupt on windows might have side effects
                        raise KeyboardInterrupt
                    os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGINT)
                return time_par()


        time_par.batched = False
        meas_ctrl.settables(time_par)
        meas_ctrl.setpoints(np.arange(10))
        meas_ctrl.gettables(SlowGettable())
        # Try interrupting me!
        dset = meas_ctrl.run("slow")
