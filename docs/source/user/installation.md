# Installation

## Stable release

This is the preferred method to install Quantify, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
If you want to contribute to Quantify, see {ref}`Setting up for local development`.

### Quick Install Guide

(This section assumes familiarity with basic software development concepts. For an extended explanation, follow the {ref}`Detailed instructions` and learn a few productivity tips on your way.)

We recommend installing `quantify-core` in a virtual environment such as
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to avoid environment-specific
problems, together with JupyterLab for its user-friendly interface for
notebooks.

:::{tab-item} macOS

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

2. If you have a newer MacBook with either an M1 or M2 chip (Apple Silicon, ARM), you will have to run `quantify-core` in an x86 compatibility mode. This is achieved by creating a Conda environment that targets the "osx-64" subdirectory, which ensures that the installation and execution will occur within an x86 environment on your MacBook.

   > ```
   > $ CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create --name quantify-env python=3.12
   > $ conda activate quantify-env
   > $ conda config --env --set subdir osx-64
   > $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
   > $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=quantify-env  --display-name="Python 3 Quantify Env"
   > $ pip install quantify-core
   >
   > $ # (Optionally) install quantify-scheduler:
   > $ pip install quantify-scheduler
   > ```

For older MacBooks, you can run

   > ```
   > $ conda create --name quantify-env python=3.12
   > $ conda activate quantify-env
   > $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
   > $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=quantify-env  --display-name="Python 3 Quantify Env"
   > $ pip install quantify-core
   >
   > $ # (Optionally) install quantify-scheduler:
   > $ pip install quantify-scheduler
   > ```

3. You are good to go! Head over to the {ref}`User guide <user-guide>` to get started.

### Detailed instructions
0. Currently, `quantify-core` is compatible with Python versions `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12` and `quantify-scheduler` with Python versions `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11` and `3.12`. To install and run `quantify` you will need to have a correct version of Python together with the `pip` Python package manager installed. To fulfill these requirements, we recommend using a virtual environment that is managed by Anaconda.

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

   > On Windows, during the installation, we recommend to select the options:
   >
   > - Install for `All Users (requires admin privileges)`; and
   > - `Add Anaconda3 the system PATH environment variable`.
   >
   > ``````{admonition} Instructions: Anaconda install (Windows)
   > :class: dropdown, info
   >
   > ```{figure} /images/install/conda_install.gif
   > :name: conda_install
   > :width: 500
   > ```
   > ``````

2. (Windows only) Install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) to have a Unix-like bash terminal (default options during installation should work well on most setups).

   > ```{tip}
   > Users can right click any folder in windows and open Git BASH in that location.
   > ```
   >
   > ```{note}
   > Be aware that a unix-like terminal on windows has some caveats. To avoid them, we recommend to run any Python code using [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (installation steps below).
   > ```

3. (Windows only) Add {code}`source /path/to/Anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` in the `.bashrc` (or in the `.bash_profile`) to expose the anaconda in the bash terminal (see instruction below if you need help).

   > ```{tip}
   > If you followed the default anaconda installation the path to it will be similar to
   > {code}`/c/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` or {code}`/c/ProgramData/Anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`.
   >
   > Pro tip: you can drag and drop a file from the file explorer into the terminal and get the path of the file (instead of typing it manually).
   > ```
   >
   > ``````{admonition} Instructions: expose anaconda in the bash terminal
   > :class: dropdown, info
   >
   > Below we illustrate this process in Git Bash. You can find detailed step-by-step instructions [here](https://superuser.com/a/602896).
   >
   > ```{figure} /images/install/conda_source_installed_all_users.gif
   > :name: conda_source
   > :width: 500
   > ```
   > ``````
   >
   > ```{note}
   > To confirm you have a functional installation of anaconda, run {code}`conda` in the terminal. This will print the conda help message which is an indication of a working installation.
   > ```

4. Create a Conda environment, see also the [Conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).

   > ```
   > $ conda create --name quantify-env python=3.12   # create the conda environment, you can replace `quantify-env` if you wish
   > $ conda activate quantify-env                   # activates the conda environment
   > ```
   >
   > ```{tip}
   > You can add {code}`conda activate quantify-env` at the end of the `.bashrc` (or `.bash_profile`) if you wish for this environment to be activated automatically in the terminal when it is opened (see instructions below).
   > ```
   >
   > ``````{admonition} Instructions: create conda env and auto-activate (Windows)
   > :class: dropdown, info
   >
   > ```{figure} /images/install/conda_activate.gif
   > :name: conda_activate
   > :width: 500
   > ```
   > ``````

5. Install `jupyter-lab` in the new environment using:

   ```
   $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab  # install jupyter lab
   $ # add the environment as an available kernel for jupyter notebook within jupyter-lab.
   $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=quantify-env  --display-name="Python 3 Quantify Env"
   ```

6. Install `quantify-core` from pypi

   > If you are interested to contribute to Quantify-core you should {ref}`set it up for local development instead <Setting up for local development>`.
   >
   > ```
   > $ pip install quantify-core
   > ```
   >
   > ```{note}
   > We currently do not have a conda recipe for installation, instead we refer to the default pip installation within a conda environment.
   > ```

7. (Optionally) install `quantify-scheduler`

   > If you are interested to contribute to `quantify-scheduler` you should {ref}`set it up for local development instead <Setting up for local development>`. You only need to replace `quantify-core` with `quantify-scheduler` in the provided commands.
   >
   > ```
   > $ pip install quantify-scheduler
   > ```

## Update to the latest version

To update Quantify to the latest version:

```
$ pip install quantify-core
```

## Setting up for local development

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up Quantify for local development.

00. Follow the {ref}`Installation` steps for your system skipping the last step ({code}`pip install ...`).

01. Fork the `quantify-core` repo on GitLab.

02. Clone your fork locally:

    ```
    $ git clone git@gitlab.com:your_name_here/quantify-core.git
    ```

03. Install `quantify-core` locally:

    ```
    $ cd quantify-core/
    $ pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

04. (Optional) Install `pre-commit` which will automatically format the code using [black](https://github.com/psf/black):

    > ```
    > $ pre-commit install
    > ```
    >
    > ```{note}
    > When the code is not well formatted a `git commit` will fail. You only need to run it again. This second time the code will be already *black*-compliant.
    > ```

05. Create a branch for local development:

    ```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

06. To ensure good quality code run [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) on your code and address any reasonable code quality issues. See [Editor and IDE integration](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/ide-integration.html) for tips on how to integrate pylint in your editor or IDE.

07. When you are done making changes, auto-format the repository with `black` and ensure test coverage

    > ```
    > $ black .
    > $ pytest --cov
    > ```
    >
    > ``````{tip}
    > Running parts of the test suite
    >
    > To run only parts of the test suite, specify the folder in which to look for
    > tests as an argument to pytest. The following example
    >
    > ```
    > $ py.test tests/measurement --cov quantify_core/measurement
    > ```
    >
    > will look for tests located in the tests/measurement directory and report test coverage of the quantify_core/measurement module.
    > ``````
    >
    > ``````{tip}
    > Speed up tests with parallel execution
    >
    > ```
    > $ py.test -n 2 # where 2 is the number of cores of your CPU
    > ```
    > ``````

08. Building the documentation

    > If you have worked on documentation or [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) you need to review how your docs look locally and ensure *no error or warnings are raised*.
    > You can build the docs locally using:
    >
    > ```
    > $ cd docs
    >
    > $ # unix
    > $ make html
    >
    > $ # windows
    > $ ./make.bat html
    > ```
    >
    > The docs will be located in `quantify_core/docs/_build`.
    >
    > ``````{tip}
    > If you are working on documentation it can be useful to automatically rebuild the docs after every change.
    > This can be done using the `sphinx-autobuild` package. Through the following command:
    >
    > ```
    > $ sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html
    > ```
    >
    > The documentation will then be hosted on `localhost:8000`
    > ``````
    >
    > ```{tip}
    > Building the tutorials can be time consuming, if you are not editing them, feel free to delete your local copy of the `quantify-core/docs/tutorials` to skip their build. You can recover the files using git (do not commit the deleted files).
    > ```

09. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab:

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

10. Review the {ref}`Merge Request Guidelines` and submit a merge request through the GitLab website.

11. Add a short entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`, commit and push.

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason you are not able to install or use Quantify using the prescribed ways indicated above, make sure you have a working Python environment (e.g. you can run an `IPython` terminal). Follow the next steps that aim at installing Quantify from source and running its tests.

0. Uninstall `quantify-core`:

   ```
   $ pip uninstall quantify-core
   ```

1. Install from source (run line by line):

   ```
   $ git clone https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core.git; cd quantify-core
   $ pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager ".[dev]"
   $ pytest -v
   ```

2. The tests will either pass or not. In any case, please report your experience and which test do not pass by creating a `New issue` on the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core/-/issues), your efforts are much appreciated and will help us to understand the problems you might be facing.

### Downgrade to a specific version

If for any reason you require a specific version of the package, e.g. 0.3.0, run:

```
$ pip install --upgrade quantify-core==0.3.0
```

### Potential issues: PyQtGraph and PyQt5

`quantify-core` has a dependency on the `PyQt5` package, which itself has a dependency on the `Qt5` runtime.
On most systems, the standard installation process will correctly install Qt.
The Anaconda installation should resolve issues with installation on Windows or macOS.
You may need to consult a search engine if you have a more exotic system.

#### macOS users

Users with newer MacBooks that have the M1 or M2 chip will face problems when installing PyQt through pip. This can be solved by installing and running `quantify-core` inside an x86 compatibility environment. Please see the macOS section of {ref}`Quick Install Guide` for instructions.
